Hi there

This is an example project for my article titled: **Building Web, Desktop and Mobile apps from a single codebase using Angular**

You can read it here: https://indepth.dev/posts/1420/building-multi-platform-apps-from-a-single-codebase-using-angular

**To run the project:**
If you forked/cloned the project, you only need to run the following commands (from the root of the project):

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start`

This will launch both the Electron and Web apps.

If you started a new Angular project from scratch - just follow the steps in the article.

Thank you for taking the time to check out the project (and hopefully the article as well).

Enjoy!
